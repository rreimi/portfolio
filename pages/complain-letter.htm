    Dear Richard McHugh,
    </p>

    <p>
    I am a student of your school English program currently coursing the B2 level, I arrived from Venezuela the fifth of February 2014. Since that day I stayed for a month in the host family house which was assigned to me. During my stay I experienced some problems that I would like to list below for you consideration:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Smoking
            <p>
                The lady living in the house smokes a lot every day and the smoke concentrated in my room and my clothes smelling were very bad, even after washing.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Dinner time
            <p>
                She became angry two times I arrived after 6pm without calling her. Those days was the second and the fourth day when I was learning about the city and I did not have my cell phone yet. If I arrived after 6pm there was no dinner. She said to me in a disrespectful way ‘I only work until 6pm’. At the end, I missed some dinners which I already paid for because of that rule.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Heating
            <p>
                The heating was turned on only few times a day and sometimes never. She had a room with a fireplace when she stay at nights watching TV, I think she did not mind about whats happening outside.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Internet Connection
            <p>
                She complained about Internet bill increase and blame me about that. But, the truth is that the Internet in that house was not working properly and I had to use the Internet connection given by my phone many times during my stay.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Disrespectful
            <p>
                A letter for me was open by her once and she never apologize.
            </p>

            <p>On the other hand, when I asked her to sign me a reference for a landlord, a guest was in the house and she started to tell him bad things about me. She was thinking that I was not understanding her, but I was. She said to the guest that she can not sign the reference because I have not paid for my accommodation yet. I complained in front of her and the guest and she changed her saying to ‘the college have not paid me to yet’. I said I have a contract with the college and I already paid for my accommodation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Insecure
            <p>
                I lost money during my stay in the house, that episode put me in a lot of stress, there was some calls and the police was involved in the situation and the money could not be recovered at the end. This is the worst part because is a serious situation, many students came her bringing their savings to learn English and accomplish a dream, losing money can be an unrecoverable situation for many students.
            </p>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <p>
        This is my experience but currently I am not the only one with problems related to host families, I have heard from friends about cases of racism and I am pretty sure that definitely this is not the image which Irish people want to show to us.
    </p>

    <p>
        I encourage you to choose carefully your host family services and choose families that really want to and are willing to host foreign students, to be clear with terms and conditions not only with students but also with families, ask students to let feedback about families and families about students as well. Also, encourage students to keep their valuables and money safe to avoid that kind of problems in the future.
    </p>

    <p>Also I want to thank you because you supported me in some of the situtations described above.</p>

    <p>
        Finally, I let you below the details about the host family I referenced above:
