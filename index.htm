                    In the beginning there was CADIVI.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    For many Venezuelans, it is a fact that we have to go through a very long process to come to Ireland and study English. It could take more time preparing your journey than living in Dublin.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The adventure for us began many months, sometimes years, before leaving Venezuela. In my case it started in August 2013 when I found a blog post about studying English in Ireland.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The first step buy a plane ticket, and it means 'choosing a date'. A dangerous step because you will be rely on many steps later that not depend on you and can result in losing your money.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-content">

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The second is about papers: letters from the college, embassy, stamps, more papers, residence letter, and many more documents. In my case my CADIVI folder had 57 pages, more than this but I am afraid.<br/>
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The third step is the most risky. Because you may have to lock, which is in some cases your life savings, the money that cover the cost of your travel for 1 or 2 months until you get the CADIVI veredict.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In my case I got the approval in January, 2 and a half weeks before the ticket day.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    After that, there were a lot of saying good bye meetings with friends and family. Very nice moments.

                    My host family needs an special mention on this book, because it has been so far the worst experience since I have been living in Dublin.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    I had a lot of problems while living there but in order to not complicate too much this part I will let you just judge my experience reading the complain letter which I wrote to the college.

                <p>I am still can not review it but I could say that it have been very difficult to read. The way the author describes things, places and people with a wide vocabulary make it complicated but also a good way to learn new words.</p>
                <p>The story has been very interesting until now, If you like fantasy and magic you might like this book</p>
